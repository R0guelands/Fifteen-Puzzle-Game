# Puzzle Game 
 This is a very simple program that tries to solve the puzzle of organizing the numbers in the board by only moving them to a free tile. The objective is to make the   board organized (1, 2, 3, 4, ... , 15).
 
 It asks if the user wants custom or default board, and then the max number of tries it has to get the most amount of correct numbers as possible. 
 
 In the end, it shows the orginal board, the final iteration and the best one (if there was no solution), as well as the best score.
