# Puzzle Game 
 This is a very simples program that tries to solve the puzzle of organizing the numbers in the board by only moving them to a free tile.
 
 It asks if the user wants or not to use a custom board, and then the number of tries it has to get the most amount of correct numbers as possible. 
 
 In the end, it shows the orginal board, the final iteration and the best one, as well as the best score.
 
 Its a brazzilian project, so variables, names and more are in portuguese for now.
